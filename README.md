# basic_yolo_webapp
This is the web part which helps you interact with the image cataloguer model

It takes in an image as the input and stores it in the static/input folder.
The model takes the input from the input folder and outputs the images in the static/output folder.
All the images present in the output folder are then dispalyed on the web page.

Before running the yolo.py the files feature_list.csv,coco.names, yolov4.cfg ,yolov4.weights must be present in the folder.(same level as yolo.py)

The cataloguer dataset must also be present in the folder.

The notebook has also been included.(image cataloguer3).
